## Acknowledgement of Country

First and foremost, we would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we gather and pay our respects to their Elders past, present, and emerging.

We acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation as the traditional custodians of this land. We recognize their deep connection to Country, their enduring cultural and spiritual relationship with the land, and their ongoing commitment to caring for and preserving the environment.

We extend our acknowledgment and respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been the custodians of the lands and waters throughout Australia since time immemorial.

Furthermore, in recognition of the contingent of attendees from across the Tasman, we wish to acknowledge and pay our respects to the Māori people, the first people of Aotearoa, New Zealand. We recognize the rich cultural heritage, knowledge systems, and contributions of the Māori people, both within Aotearoa and beyond.

## Housekeeping

A little bit of housekeeping before we go on.

All plenaries and the breakout session 1 are in this room, while the breakout room 2 is over in Seminar room 4.5., which is a little bit more intimate.

Lunch, Morning and Afternoon teas are in RL Harris room, which is where you registered this morning.

Bathrooms are unfortunately quite a long way away

There will be a photographer here for a couple of hours this afternoon, so if you're on the run from the law, you might want to take note of the exits. If you wish to not be photographed, let us know, and we will be sure to vet the photos before we release any. We also hope to take a group photo in the courtyard, which we'll do at our afternoon tea, before anyone goes to get tea or coffee. It shouldn't take any longer than a few minutes. I myself was omitted from the photo in 2019 because I was in the loo at the time, so I also advise holding on.

This evening, at 5:30, we have a space, a bar tab, and finger food at the Marlborough Hotel, and everyone is invited. I assume there'll be a caravan of us heading up there when we finish the sessions at around 5:00, but if you need to head to your hotel before coming, there are walking directions and the address in the program.

## Program

If you scan the QR code on your conference ID card, you'll be taken to the online, interactive program.

Each session links to its description, and to the presenter profiles. Also, the current session in the program will be highlighted automatically throughout the two days, so if you check the page and can't remember the time, or whether you've just had lunch, or even what day it is, the program will let you know.

One part of the program that I'd like to call attention to is the open discussion which will wrap up proceedings. The program has quite a lot of discussion around governance, installation, upgrades, testing, managing relationships with IT, and we're hoping that all of those learnings can generate some frank discussion about how REDCap ought to be managed. 

A specific aspect of this, fittingly, right at the end of the program, is what we do about project closure, if anything. I am personally looking forward to some ideas coming out of this conference that we can take back to the Community, and advocate for new features that help us manage our REDCap environments, make our lives easier as admins and maintain an exceptional level of security for our researchers' participants..

## Organising Committee

I'd like to take the opportunity to say thanks to lots of people. 

Thanks to the organising committee for the contribution of their time. All of us have our regular jobs, and fitting in time to put together this conference wasn't always easy. This conference wouldn't have happened without their input.

I'd like to specifically thank Yelena Fridgant and Lindy Masya, not just for providing the venue, but also for their experience in running conferences. This is my first rodeo, but not theirs.

Thanks to all presenters for their efforts in creating their presentations and sharing their knowledge so generously with this community. Without the presenters there clearly wouldn't be anything worth conferring over.

Lastly, thanks to all of you for coming. In the last few years we have all got used to online or hybrid conferences, so it might have been a challenge to convince your employers of the value of travelling for a conference. We thought about how we would run this and we came to the conclusion that one of the most importance aspects of conferences like this is the community of practice that we build, the relationships we form. Running such a conference virtually might be better than not at all, but it misses that core social aspect.

So thanks to everyone.

## Keynote

It gives me great pleasure to introduce our keynote session this morning, and our presenters Colleen Tompkins and Jacky Lipson, from Australian Catholic University and Murdoch Children's Research Institute. Colleen and Jacky are here today to brief us on the Envisage project.

This is a project I have had a little to do with over the years and I thought this would be a great talk to set the scene for this conference. We as REDCap administrators often help with a project in the design phase or if there are issues, but we seldom hear about the great work that users are doing.
