# Upgrading REDCap

I want you to understand, in general terms, what is involved in upgrading REDCap so that you can put pressure on your local IT to take ownership of it.

We're going to talk about what's involved in an upgrade, what kinds of access to the server and the database is required, and who should be involved.

I'll talk a little about the before and after


I remember waking up one day in April to a post on community that started "This is not a drill folks".

What followed was a scrambling of sites around the world struggling to get their REDCap environments updates to the latest, only to have to do it again, and again, when more vulnerabilities were discovered.

It was obvious form the community that lots of sites were out of their depth. The system had been inherited by someone, and everyone who knew anything about it had left, or IT helped out with installation but then weren't able to help with upgrades.

There were some positive stories; I was speaking with a REDCap admin from an Australian university who told me that IT were not particularly helpful and they wouldn't help them upgrade, and so they were stuck on version 9. When REDCapMageddon hit, IT suddenly found the goodwill needed to help out.

I found myself in meetings with poor IT folk, delving into a Unix system for the first time time in their life, being asked questions like "Do you have the root DB account password?"


So this talk is inspired by the events of April and May. And I hope that this helps smaller institutions understand what's needed, and helps them get the help from their local IT.
