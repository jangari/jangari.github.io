- Decisions about platforms then depend on these platforms<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Data classification may assist here<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes: In the absence of locally provided platforms that are appropriate for the collection, generation and storage of data, for the recording of interviews and the transcription of recordings, researchers will necessarily use third party platforms. Our job is to help them make the right decisions based on their requirements, and the terms of service of those platforms.

A data classification may assist here, in allowing researchers to determine the level of sensitivity of their datasets, and thus choose a platform or a service that suits.
