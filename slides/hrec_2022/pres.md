# Data Storage Implications for Third Party Services

Notes: I'm Aidan and I'm the Digital Research Analyst here at ACU, which means that I work between ORS and IT, helping them understand each other, and I also work with researchers when they need help or support with technology. Data storage is something I help out with quite a lot, and we in the eResearch team offer advice to researchers when they need to store data in particular places, encouraging them to use more university-standardised locations and services where appropriate, or thinking through some edge cases, such as when those researchers are collaborating with others outside the university. So it is in that context that I'm going to talk about data storage implications for third party services, and I'll speak specifically about Zoom, because it's a bit complicated here, but the general principles can apply to other sorts of services.

## Outline

- What is 'third party'?
- What's the problem?
- Data Storage
- Recordings
- Transcriptions
- General Guidelines

Notes: I'll talk about what I mean by third party, because it can mean different things to different people. Then I'll raise the main problem that we're trying to solve here, before I go into some areas that are impacted by this, namely, storage of data, of recordings, and transcriptions, both of which are related. Finally I'll raise some general guidelines.

## Third Party

"A third person or organization less directly involved in a matter than the main people or organizations that are involved" - Cambridge Dictionary

"Third party is also used to refer to outsourcing certain functions to an outside company to ensure efficient service for clients." - Investopedia

Notes: Third party obviously has a legal definition, which is this definition from Cambridge, but the specific meaning I'm using is this one by Investopedia. So the first two parties are ACU as a whole, and the researcher. Third party services therefore refers to any service that is utilised by the researcher but which is not provided by the university.
